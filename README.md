# Octomate Voting Frontend

A simple React-based voting application built for a technical test. This frontend interfaces with a backend API to provide a voting system where users can vote for holiday destinations.

## Features

- **Role-based Authentication**: Separate interfaces for Admin and User roles
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, view voting results, and system administration
- **User Voting Interface**: Vote for holiday destinations with predefined options or custom choices
- **Real-time Updates**: Vote changes are reflected immediately
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components

## User Roles

### Admin
- Access user management (create, list users)
- View voting results and statistics
- Administrative dashboard

### User
- Vote for holiday destinations
- Choose from predefined options or enter custom destinations
- Modify vote choices

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** + **DaisyUI** for styling
- **React Hook Form** for form handling
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd octomate-voting-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` to point to your backend API (default: `http://localhost:8080`)

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Backend Integration

This frontend expects a backend API running with the following endpoints:
- `POST /auth/admin/login` - Admin authentication
- `POST /auth/user/login` - User authentication
- `GET /vote/current` - Get current user's vote
- `GET /vote/options` - Get predefined voting options
- `POST /vote` - Submit/update vote
- `GET /admin/summary` - Get voting statistics (admin only)
- User management endpoints for admin operations

## Development Notes

This project was built as a technical test submission for a backend position. The frontend is intentionally simple to demonstrate integration capabilities with the primary backend implementation. The focus is on clean code structure, proper authentication flow, and seamless API integration.
